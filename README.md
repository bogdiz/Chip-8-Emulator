# Chip-8-Emulator
A Chip-8 emulator is an interpreted programming language. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.
I mimicked the components of a Chip-8 in my emulator, as it follows:
  -registers;
  -memory;
  -program counter;
  -stack;
  -delay & sound timer;
  -16 input keys;
  -64x32 monochrome display memory;
